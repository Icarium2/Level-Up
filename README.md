# Code Review by Gilda Ahmadniaye Jourshary and Emil Pettersson

1. Can’t shoot without moving at the same time

2. Could add the 'dist' folder in .gitignore

3. game.js: 122-123 left over console.log 

4. game.js:96-98 const or let is recommended over var.

5. How do you kill the enemy?
 
6. Hearts(life) is very small, could be nice to have it bigger so you notice that you’re losing health 

7. Would also be nice to have some type of indication that you lose health by the monster

8. The audio music is cool and sets a spooky mood, eerie and nice. Sometimes the music restarts over eachother and it plays again over the current track? Not sure if it’s just for me or not. 

9. Favicon is missing

10. No support for mobile
